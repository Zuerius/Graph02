This program furthers Graph01. In addition to organizing ordered pairs into a graph, it will also run a DPS on the graph.

"make scc03" will make the proper files.
Run it by giving it a file to read from, in the format "scc03 testfile"

scc03.c will take ordered pairs as inputs and print them in an organized manner. 
Then it will run a depth first search on the graph that was created and show the discover time, finish time, and parent. 
Then it will print out a stack of the vertices in reverse finish time order.
